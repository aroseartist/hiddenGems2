2,505 Sansome Street,1980 Good,"A greenhouse in the lobby of this office building faces and 6 connects to Redwood Park. Its two-story glass walls create an
airy interior, featuring granite flooring, several paintings and eight tables, each with three to four chairs of beautiful modern design.

3,3 emPiRe PaRk ,1988 Good,"From the Commercial Street lunchtime mall the visitor enters
this intimate urban garden, occupying the site of a demolished building. The design is symmetrical, with brick planter beds and sitting ledges along both sides and a fountain sculpture at the
end of the central axis. Benches and tables with chairs complete
the furnishings of this enjoyable space. Needed improvements: Restroom availability.",,,,,"37.794511, -122.403843",https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40044962/MeetForFree/popos_images/Empire-Park.jpg,,,,,
4,embaRcaDeRO cenTeR WeST ,1989 Fair/Good,"The first of the three open spaces here is the conversion of Commercial Street between Sansome & Battery into an exclusive pedestrian walkway. There are small seating areas on the
second level and elaborate stairs flanked by narrow waterfalls
that bring the second-story walkway to street level at mid-block.
The second half of the street has two rows of trees in circular 8 planters with ledges too low to sit on comfortably. Tables and
chairs that had been placed between trees have been removed. Also gone are adjacent food services.
The second, at the Old Federal Reserve Bank building, consists of the generous steps (snippets) to the historic building from both Battery and Sansome streets.
The third, on the south side of Sacramento between Sansome
& Battery, is a two-level snippet, west of the office building.
Grey granite covers the ground level, steps and retaining wall
with attached seating ledges. The space also features potted 9 plants and a sculpture as well as moveable tables and chairs,
and adjacent food services.",,,,,"37.795183, -122.397395",https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40044962/MeetForFree/popos_images/Embarcadero-Center-Walkways.jpg,,,,,
5,650 caliFORnia ST.,1965 Poor,"There are two largely barren plazas: one at the California Street front entrance, and one behind the building, with white concrete benches and large circular raised planters with edges suitable for seating. Planters with boxwood and hydrangea are arranged on stone pavement.

6,600 caliFORnia ST.,1990 Fair,"This snippet has no amenities and no seating except the stairs, but it sports one of the densest assemblages of public art pieces downtown, including the Art Deco elevator doors on the loggia wall at the main entrance, Bella Feldman’s sculpture inside the bank lobby, Kent Robert’s aqueduct/railroad trestle/elevated highway on the stairway and Bruce Beasley’s bronze sculpture on top of the stairs, placed on granite cobblestones. Needed improvements: landscaping, seating",,,,,"37.793150, -122.404890",,,,,,
7,555 caliFORnia ST.,1969 Fair,"The red granite used on the outside of this building extends to the pavement, railing and steps of this grand, almost forbidding plaza. The massive black granite sculpture accentuates this impression. On the northeast corner, there is an urban garden with six large wooden planters with olive trees and bamboo and beautifully designed teak benches. There is no restroom access or adjacent food service. Open at all times.",,,,,"37.792240, -122.403705",,,,,,
8,345 caliFORnia ST.,1986 Poor,"This shady snippet on California Street is located in a deeply
recessed entry to the office building. Granite benches are lined
up against a wall on one side. Also, some planters have been
placed along the building walls. An additional row of benches on the opposite side would make the space more useful. Open at all times. Needed improvements: landscaping, seating",,,,,"37.792661, -122.400274",,,,,,
9,200 caliFORnia ST.,1990 Fair,"This public sitting area in a pedestrian walkway was created 17 in an extension of the sidewalk. It has a rectangular planting bed
with ledges that are a bit too high for sitting comfortably, and
features the Hawaiian, a figurative bronze sculpture. The planting
bed replaced the benches and other pieces of furniture of the
original installation. Open at all times.",,,,,"37.793830, -122.399030",,,,,,
10,150 caliFORnia ST.,2000 Good,"The sign near the building entrance indicating the existence of a 18 publicly accessible sun terrace is small, dark and very difficult
to read. The lobby guard will ask visitors their purpose but will
allow the public to pass. The sun terrace is oriented toward Front Street, has tables and chairs, plants and public art. It also offers sunny, shady and wind protected areas. Open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Needed improvements: signage at entrance and lobby

11,100 Pine ST.,1972 Excellent,"This urban garden is tucked between very tall buildings. It’s
a quiet little gem of a space, accessible through the lobby to the rear or via an obscure passage off Front Street. Travertine and black granite flooring, an art piece, plants in containers and designer tables and chairs. Food services on site. Receives no sun, but light colored materials and reflected light stave off gloom. Café closes at 3 p.m., building and garden at 6:30 p.m.

12,50 caliFORnia ST.,1972 Excellent,"This snippet, occupying the building setback, is an extension of the design and material from the open space across the street. Variously shaped planters, with ledges at sitting height, have been placed on rose-colored granite and green stone pavement. A small café with outdoor seating enlivens the space. Open at all times.",,,,,"37.794302, -122.397360",,,,,,
13,One caliFORnia ST.,1970 Excellent,"The snippets around this building feature large stone planters
of triangular, rectangular and round shapes along Market and California streets, some with trees and benches. The pavement consists of green stone and rose-colored granite.

14,101 caliFORnia,1982 Excellent,"Three tall, triangular, stepped pyramids, built around the garage exhaust vents, dominate this urban garden within a large plaza. The steps are clad with granite, and are used for seating and as planting beds. There is a granite fountain, with gushing water creating a pleasant sound. Two restaurants on the building’s ground floor open to the plaza with outdoor seating. Open at all times. Across the street, at 100 California Street, large planters have been placed on the sizable building setbacks. With some seating, the space could be easily converted into an attractive urban garden.",,,,,"37.792990, -122.397870",,,,,,
15,444 Market St.,1980 Poor,"This plaza leading to the Market Street building entrance is an extension of the brick sidewalk of Market Street. It has no seating, and except for five small palm trees in planters, it offers no amenity. Adjacent to Mechanics Plaza. Three food services are nearby. Open at all times. Needed improvements: landscaping and seating",,,,,"37.791635, -122.398805",,,,,,
16,One Bush ST,1959 Fair/Excellent,"A beautifully designed and maintained urban garden surrounds the first postwar high-rise building — a “tower in a park.” It features river rocks embedded in concrete, inlaid with a striking design of bands of grey slate. A fountain sculpture spouts and drips water. The planting consists of cherry, willow and pine trees and evergreen ground cover. The garden lies below street level and resembles a moat. It is for visual enjoyment only; no seating has been provided, the river rocks are hard to walk on and no food service is available. Needed improvements: seating in garden, food service On sunny days the stone walls along the Sansome Street sidewalk (snippets) are well used for lunching and peoplewatching. Open at all times.",,,,,"37.791208, -122.399951",,,,,,
17,Citigroup Center Atrium (1 Sansome Street),1983 Excellent,"This greenhouse is built into the shell of the 1912 London-Paris Bank building, with a glass roof and two-story arches opening to Sansome and Sutter Streets. The material for the arches, the walls, the entrance steps and the floor is white marble with additional black marble bands and a round black polished marble fountain in the center. Palm trees and other plants soften the severity of the space. An Art Deco bronze sculpture graces a marble niche. A food service opens to the space and café tables and chairs have been provided. There is also a seating area inside the building lobby",,,,,"37.790723, -122.401112",,,,,,
18,Trinity Alley,1983 Good,"The adjacent office tower converted Trinity Alley into a pedestrian walkway (connecting Bush to Sutter Street) by removing the curb and lining the roadbed with small granite pavers, and adding a narrow plaza by creating narrow platform steps up in the side setback of the building. Five food services open out to the plaza, and have put out chairs and tables during business hours. Open at all times. Needed improvements: seating for general public",,,,,"37.790306, -122.402583",,,,,,
19,Crocker Galleria,1982 Good,"There are two rooftop sun terraces here that are open whenever the Galleria is open. One sun terrace is on top of the historic bank building at Montgomery and Post Streets, and is accessed from a staircase on the easterly side of the Galleria’s top floor or from an elevator at the corner of the bank building.The terrace has ample seating on planter ledges and benches, but no tables. An attractive fountain is out of service. A second sun terrace can be accessed from an obscure staircase in the northwest corner of the Galleria’s top floor. It is a quiet refuge, offering sunny and shady places, many benches, a trellis and planters. There are many food services in the Galleria. Restrooms are on the third floor. Needed improvements: repair fountain, better signage to the second terrace",,,,,"37.789738, -122.403019",,,,,,
20,One Post Street,1969 Good,"Snippets with stand-up tables and square concrete blocks at sitting height next to food services. A few planters with boxwood were created when the arcade of the building was partially enclosed. They are adjacent to the steps around the hexagonal fence of the Montgomery BART station entrance, which are very well used at lunchtime on a sunny day. Open at all times.",,,,,"37.788970, -122.402687",,,,,,
21,595 Market Street ,1979 Poor,"The approval of this building called for two triangular entryway plazas. One, at Second and Stevenson Streets, largely has been occupied by a fenced restaurant seating area. Outside, a 10-foot-wide edge of the plaza faces Stevenson Street. It has good sun exposure, and with the addition of benches and landscaping could become a pleasant public sitting area. Needed improvements: public seating",,,,,"37.789419, -122.400768",,,,,,
22,555/575 Market St.,1965/1975 Fair,The beautifully landscaped urban garden takes up the space between two highrises. A stylized version of a mountain stream runs through it. Unfortunately this is for visual enjoyment only since access is limited to office tenants only. Benches placed at the Market Street entrance and on the circular platform that floats above the space would make it more enjoyable.
